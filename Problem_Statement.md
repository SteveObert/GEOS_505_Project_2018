## Steve Obert


The goal of this project is to plot runoff characteristics of the Main Salomon River in Idaho. The project will compare average and maximum stream daily discharge from several USGS gauges within the Salmon River Drainage to time series snow melt by elevation. It is important to understand snowmelt driven river discharge timing in order to predict stream flows.

Data for this project will include; USGS historical stream flow discharge, MODIS NDSI Snow Cover data, and elevation data. The following USGS streamflow gauges will be used: Main Salmon at Whitebird, Middle fork Salmon lodge near Yellowpine, Salmon River at Shoup, SF Salmon River near Krassel Ranger Station, and Johnson Creek at Yellow Pine. STRM or a DEM will provide elevation data.

Analysis of the data will provide a graph of all the gauges displaying the discharge timing of the selected tributaries relative to each other and the Whtebird gauge. The project should also result in a discharge graph for each tributary overlain by snow coverage by elevation. The latter will, hopefully, show a correlation between each drainageâ€™s discharge and elevations which drive the yearly fluctuations.
